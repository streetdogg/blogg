        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing I realized after landing on the spongy bed was -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s usually we who stand in our own way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning is more a matter of choice and will than practice, training and genius. You either choose to win or the devil’s advocate in you convinces you to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no clue, even today what had made me sign up for the High Jump. Sure I was called the monkey by my mates usually, but jumping 5ft is not my cup of tea. Truth be told, when I looked at the beam (which I was supposed to jump over) placed 3.5ft high, I was wondering how can anyone jump over it. It was paralyzing me mentally. I was convinced that it was hard, it was impossible. Except something inside me said,” It’s ok to screw up. Go jump!” I took a step back, ran, gathered the momentum and with all my might launched into the air. Over the next fraction of a second, I was on the other side of the beam. I had made it. I had done what a while ago seemed impossible. I ended up jumping as high as 4 point something feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing things happened when I was in mid-air. While in flight. I had surrendered myself. My mind had stopped talking. I couldn’t hear anything. The world around had paused. Eyes were open yet I could see nothing. I had surrendered myself to whatever would happen. Covered with a sense of peace, contentment and stillness. A state, we all in the modern world crave for. I never knew that side of me existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is clear though, I don’t know what brings happiness but contentment comes with Micro-Achievements. Daily small wins!&lt;/p&gt;
